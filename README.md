# Dogs

The purpose of this project was to give more information on a dog tag. Dog tags only contain a name and a number.
I think it would be great to give more information like breed, age, temperament, and any medical information. 
These are simple webpages that give all this information as well as a picture that I made using Bootstrap.
I made a simple template where I could add dogs easily in the future.
