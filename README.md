# Dogs

The purpose of this project was to give more information on a dog tag. Dog tags only contain a name and a number.
I think it would be great to give more information like breed, age, temperament, and any medical information.
I am also able to include more ways to contact me than just a number. 
These are simple webpages that give all this information as well as a picture that I made using Bootstrap.
I made a simple template where I could add dogs easily in the future.

I use this by creating webpages with my information and my dogs information and creating QR codes that I will put on their collars.
